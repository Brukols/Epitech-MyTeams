        The server must be able to accept multiple clients, to send replies to a specific client, and to broadcast a message to multiple clients.

      <t>
	    The server must be able to keep data about users, teams, channels and threads.
        Clients with the right permissions must be able to access that data.
        The server should store the data so it can be reused after a restart.
      </t>
      <t>
	    Users must be able to create teams, channels, and threads. They also must be able to create replies in threads and send private messages to other users.
        All of this information must be able to be accessed by users if they have the right permissions.
      </t>
      <t>
	    Some events must be broadcasted to multiple connected clients, please refer to the Reply Codes and Commands sections for more information about broadcasted events.

      <t>
        The server must answer clients' requests with replies.
        A reply starts with a header describing the reply (unsigned short: fisrt two bytes) and the size of the arguments (int: last four bytes).
        The header is followed by the arguments of the reply.

  <!-- References Section -->

  <!-- Section 4.7f of [RFC2223bis] specifies the requirements for the
       references sections.  In particular, there MUST be separate lists of
       normative and informative references, each in a separate section.
       The style SHOULD follow that of recently published RFCs.

The standard MIB boilerplate available at
the OPS Area web site includes lists of
normative and informative references that MUST appear in all IETF
specifications that contain MIB modules.  If items from other MIB
modules appear in an IMPORTS statement in the Definitions section,
then the specifications containing those MIB modules MUST be included
in the list of normative references.  When items are imported from an
IANA-maintained MIB module the corresponding normative reference
SHALL reference the on-line version of that MIB module.  It is the
policy of the RFC Editor that all references must be cited in the
text;  such citations MUST appear in the overview section where
documents containing imported definitions (other than those already
mentioned in the MIB boilerplate) are required to be mentioned (cf.
Section 3.2).

In general, each normative reference SHOULD reference the most recent
version of the specification in question.
