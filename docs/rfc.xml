                are Normative references, so the citations should exist in the narrative
                section of the internet draft. The preferred
                way to fill in a REFERENCE clause in a MIB module is of the form: "Guidelines

                    areas within the Interface MIB. These areas were intentionally left
                    vague in the Interface MIB to avoid over-constraining the MIB, thereby
                    precluding management of certain media-types. Section 4 of [RFC2863] enumerates several
                    areas which a media-specific MIB must clarify. The implementor is
                    referred to [RFC2863] in order to understand the

                The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
                proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

            <t><cref>[TEMPLATE TODO] else if there are no read-write or read-create objects in your MIB module,

            <t>There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
                a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. So, if this MIB
                module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder
                can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct
                SNMP SET operations.</t>

            <t><cref>For all MIB modules you must evaluate whether any readable objects
                are sensitive or vulnerable (for instance, if they might reveal customer
                information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
                European Union if exposed to unathorized parties).</cref></t>

            <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
                MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
                vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control

            <t><cref>[TEMPLATE TODO] The following three boilerplate paragraphs

            <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
                Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
                there is no control as to who on the secure network is
                allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
                in this MIB module.</t>

            <t>   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
                SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance
                to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and
                privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM) [RFC3414] with the AES
                cipher algorithm [RFC3826]. Implementations MAY also provide support for
                the Transport Security Model (TSM) [RFC5591] in combination with a secure
                transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353]. </t>

            <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
                RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
                cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator responsibility to
                ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB
                module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to
                those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or

        <!-- References Section -->

        <!-- Section 4.7f of [RFC2223bis] specifies the requirements for the
       references sections.  In particular, there MUST be separate lists of
       normative and informative references, each in a separate section.
       The style SHOULD follow that of recently published RFCs.

       The standard MIB boilerplate available at
      the OPS Area web site includes lists of
       normative and informative references that MUST appear in all IETF
       specifications that contain MIB modules.  If items from other MIB
       modules appear in an IMPORTS statement in the Definitions section,
       then the specifications containing those MIB modules MUST be included
       in the list of normative references.  When items are imported from an
       IANA-maintained MIB module the corresponding normative reference
       SHALL reference the on-line version of that MIB module.  It is the
       policy of the RFC Editor that all references must be cited in the
       text;  such citations MUST appear in the overview section where
       documents containing imported definitions (other than those already
       mentioned in the MIB boilerplate) are required to be mentioned (cf.
       Section 3.2).

    In general, each normative reference SHOULD reference the most recent
    version of the specification in question.
